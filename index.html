    <p>Actually, music gave me the support when I needed it.<strong> I would never have gone to college unless I’d gotten a piano scholarship</strong>. And now I’m so glad I got to learn to play the cello, which is a different experience, you’re flexing a different muscle, but it’s beautiful because it is music</p>

    <h3>Scholarships</h3>
    <p>Scholarships are important to career and educational progress. They provide an opportunity for many people to earn an education.</p>
    
    <p>Without assistance from an outside source, students may have trouble paying for the degree they need in order to enter the workforce and become contributing members of society. The path to higher education is not always easy, and many students need help along the way</p>
    
    <p>Scholarships for people in the field of public health can be difficult to find. This is because many sites that curate scholarship opportunities focus on other fields or they compile opportunities from so many fields making it difficult for you to find those related to public health</p>

Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster</p>
    <p>Volunteering can help you make friends, learn new skills, advance your career, and even feel happier and healthier. Learn how to find the right volunteer opportunity for you. Volunteering can also help you build upon skills you already have and use them to benefit the greater community. </p>
