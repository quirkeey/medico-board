            <h2>Scholarships</h2>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Actually, music gave me the support when I needed it.<strong> I would never have gone to college unless I’d gotten a piano scholarship</strong>. And now I’m so glad I got to learn to play the cello, which is a different experience, you’re flexing a different muscle, but it’s beautiful because it is music</p>
            <cite>Jamie Foxx</cite>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Scholarships are important to career and educational progress. They provide an opportunity for many people to earn an education.</p>
            
            <p>Without assistance from an outside source, students may have trouble paying for the degree they need in order to enter the workforce and become contributing members of society.</p>
            
            <p>The path to higher education is not always easy, and many students need help along the way</p>
