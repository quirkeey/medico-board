            <p>Actually, music gave me the support when I needed it.<strong> I would never have gone to college unless I’d gotten a piano scholarship</strong>. And now I’m so glad I got to learn to play the cello, which is a different experience, you’re flexing a different muscle, but it’s beautiful because it is music</p>
